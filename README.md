# A Typescript Ray Tracer

This is a simple ray tracer I am building for fun.
It is based on the recursive ray tracer described by Whitted's An Improved Illumination Model for Shaded Dysplay ((pdf)[https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~david/Classes/CS586/Papers/p343-whitted.pdf]).

## How to build and run the project

This is written with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I installed the typescript transpiler with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

I also used [Direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) to correcly set up the export needed to use `tsc`.
